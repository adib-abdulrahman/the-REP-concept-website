You should produce a web page (or a set of pages) that use the following tags:

<html>
<head>
<title>
<body>

<p>
<h1> <h2> <h3>

<img> including the src, alt, height and width attributes.

<a> including the href attribute. The target attribute is also useful for links to other websites.

<div> to divide your page into named sections (This will be used in a future exercise)

<li>
<ol>
<ul>

<form>
<input> where the input is a textbox  or a submit button
